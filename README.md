Rule Engine with AST App
Overview
The Rule Engine with AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) app is a Kotlin-based application that allows users to define and execute business rules in a structured format. It utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree for rule evaluation, Room Database for data storage, and XML for the user interface. The app provides a dynamic and flexible way to process conditions and trigger actions based on user-defined rules, without modifying the core code.

Features
Rule Definition: Users can define rules using a domain-specific language (DSL) or structured format.
AST-based Evaluation: Rules are represented as an AST for efficient parsing and execution.
Room Database: Rules and associated data are stored locally using Room for persistence.
Dynamic Rule Execution: Process conditions, evaluate input data, and trigger corresponding actions dynamically.
XML-based UI: A user-friendly interface for defining and managing rules.
Logging & Reporting: Track rule execution and results for debugging and auditing.
Tech Stack
Language: Kotlin
Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
Database: Room Database
UI: XML-based Layouts

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rule-engine-ast-app.git
Open in Android Studio: Open the project in Android Studio, and allow Gradle to sync.

Run the Project: Run the project on an Android device or emulator.

Key Components
1. AST Rule Evaluation
Rules are parsed into an AST format to allow flexible execution.
The app evaluates conditions using the tree structure, ensuring scalability for complex rule sets.
2. Room Database Integration
The app uses Room Database to store rules and related data.
Users can save and retrieve their defined rules for future use.
3. UI Design (XML)
The app's user interface is built with XML layouts, providing an intuitive experience for managing rules.
Users can add, edit, and delete rules using the provided interface.
How It Works
Define Rules: Users create rules through the UI. Each rule consists of conditions (if-else logic) and actions.
AST Representation: The rules are converted into an AST structure, which represents the logic as a tree.
Rule Evaluation: When an event is triggered, the AST is evaluated to determine which actions should be executed based on the given conditions.
Data Storage: Rules and inputs are stored in the Room Database for persistence.

Project Structure
data: Contains Room database entities, DAOs, and data sources.
ui: Contains XML layouts and UI logic.
viewmodel: Implements ViewModel classes to manage data flow and interaction between the UI and data layers.
repository: Optional, for handling data interactions.
model: AST model representing rule structures.
